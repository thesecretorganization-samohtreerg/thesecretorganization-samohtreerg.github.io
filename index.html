    <h1>The Organization</h1>

    <main>
        <section class="intro">
            <h2>Welcome to The Organization</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2015, The Organization was built upon one principle: preservation through control. While the
                public
                systems fell into corruption and hesitation, we acted. We watched governments falter, cities crumble,
                and
                leaders bend beneath the weight of indecision. From that ruin, The Organization emerged, focused, and
                unstoppable.</p>
            <p>Our purpose is simple: restore balance to the world. We do not seek fame or acknowledgment. The
                world will never see our faces, but it will feel our work. The path to order has never been clean, yet
                it must be walked. We have taken that burden willingly.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Directive</h2>
            <p>The Directive is the core law of The Organization. It defines every act and every silence. Members are
                required to uphold it without question. It provides the structure that holds The Organization together.
            </p>

            <button class="menu-toggle base">Primary Objective</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>To reshape the balance of global control through correction and replacement. When a structure
                    collapses,
                    we
                    do not rebuild it. We overwrite it. When a leader falters, we remove them. When data is stolen, we
                    destroy it. Order will not return on its own. It must be taken back.</p>
            </ul>
            <button class="menu-toggle base">Secondary Objective</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>To ensure the Awakening proceeds without obstruction. Interference is to be contained, silenced, or
                    erased. The Awakening will signal the transition from a world of chaos to a world of control. We are
                    ready for that transition.</p>
            </ul>
            <button class="menu-toggle base">Ethical Clause</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>The Organization acts not in cruelty but in necessity. The future demands sacrifice. We do what must
                    be
                    done so that others may live unaware of the danger that surrounded them. History rewards results,
                    not
                    hesitation.</p>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Operations</h2>
            <p>The Organization's reach extends through every layer of modern civilization. We have embedded agents,
                analysts, and constructs in dozens of institutions. We work through the systems that once failed
                humanity,
                using their own designs to create something stronger. When authority loses sight of its
                duty, when order becomes too soft, we act. Our role is to replace fractured complexes with superior
                systems
                of justice and power.</p>

            <button class="menu-toggle base">Division Alpha</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>Alpha handles infiltration, intelligence, and resource acquisition. Their operations include the
                    silent
                    recovery of high-value technology from restricted facilities and the extraction of data from
                    government
                    networks previously believed secure. In 2022, Alpha succeeded in acquiring a prototype surveillance
                    core
                    from an abandoned defense sector vault. That core now fuels The Organization's predictive systems.

            <button class="menu-toggle base">Division Theta</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>Theta oversees physical construction and control structures. They build, maintain, and hide what must
                    never be found. Towers of observation, monuments of signal alignment, and devices of unseen reach
                    stand
                    across the globe under ordinary disguises. Each one has purpose, listening and fueling our
                    collection of
                    knowledge.</p>

            <ul class="menu">
                <p>IX directs the ongoing research into dimensional assistance and the summoning of auxiliaries, beings
                    beyond known reality, loyal through binding oaths. Communication with these entities has advanced
                    since
                    2021, though few have survived the first contact phase. Division IX also manages the upcoming
                    calibration event in the western region. The event countdown is active.</p>

            <h2>The Awakening</h2>
            <p>The Awakening is the final stage of the Directive. It marks the shift from passive observation to active
                governance. Once triggered, the network will synchronize through the monuments and signals positioned
                over the last five years. The result will be irreversible. The old world will fall quickly.</p>

            <button class="menu-toggle base">Phase I - Construction</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>2015-2020. Establishment of hidden infrastructure. Data nodes placed beneath key public structures
                    and transmission stations disguised as cell towers. Completion verified in 2020 with the
                    construction
                    of the Azusa calibration site. Radiation from the network caused side effects, creating the
                    appearance of
                    a pandemic. These side effects were unintended, but it did not stop our progress.</p>
            </ul>

            <button class="menu-toggle base">Phase II - Convergence</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>2021-2025. The Organization began synchronization of its global signal points. The final calibration
                    took longer than expexted. Some say it was "the chosen one" who's power slowed the alignment.
                    Eight nodes are ready. One remains. When alignment completes, the sequence will begin automatically.
                    Division IX has confirmed all readings are stable.</p>
            </ul>

            <button class="menu-toggle base">Phase III - Awakening</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>Pending. Once triggered, all harmonic systems will activate simultaneously. Those not aligned with
                    The
                    Organization will experience temporary disorientation. Control will pass seamlessly into the new
                    structure. Ultimately, the target coordinates will be destroyed.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Volunteer Integration</h2>
            <p>The Organization requires individuals capable of discipline and silence. Volunteers are chosen carefully
                by
                The Founder himself. Once inside, they work on projects beyond the understanding of ordinary
                institutions.
                Dimensional openings, surveillance development, behavioral calibration, and containment of anomalies.
                Submission
                to higher command is mandatory.</p>

            <button class="menu-toggle base">Application Requirements</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>Only those with verified loyalty and technical capability are considered. Psychological screening is
                    ongoing. The participents are injected and sent through the nullification process before they are
                    ready to be a part of The Organization. Those found unsuitable are repurposed into auxiliary test
                    operations.</p>
            </ul>

            <button class="menu-toggle base">Dimensional Summoning</button>
            <ul class="menu">
                <p>The Organization has confirmed limited success in drawing entities from parallel strata. These
                    helpers,
                    often referred to as "shadows of alignment", assist in maintaining the Awakening network. Each
                    manifestation consumes a measurable amount of energy, extracted from nearby electrical grids during
                    the summoning sequence.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Public Relations</h2>
            <p>The Organization does not engage directly with governments or media outlets. Public awareness is
                considered
                contamination. Yet we understand the need for stability among the uninformed population. Therefore,
                we will reveal our preasence to the public after the Awakening is completed.</p>
            <p>Rumors of rebellion persist. Some claim a "chosen one" exists. An individual capable of breaking the
                sequence. These are misinformation. The Organization will preveil.</p>

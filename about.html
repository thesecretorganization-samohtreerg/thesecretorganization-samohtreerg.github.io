            <p>
                The Organization was formally established in 2015 under the direction of The Founder. Initial
                documentation records that the first directives were issued from a residential district outside Los
                Angeles. Though resources were limited, The Founder demonstrated early insight into data manipulation,
                behavioral control, and systemic design. The Organization's purpose was declared as "preservation through
                control," a statement that has remained unchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
                From its origin, operations expanded rapidly. The Founder oversaw the integration of the first
                information relay system, known as the Gridline, which enabled direct communication between independent
                field cells. Within six months, coordinated actions were taking place across three continents. The
                Founder's methods were unconventional, but effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2018, the Primary Directive was issued, redefining the Organization's mission parameters to include
                government structural influence and hierarchical replacement. This marked the beginning of a new
                Era. Attack lines, laboratories, and administration teams were formed. Protocols were enforced. Errors were
                removed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Under Nivlac's continued guidance, the Organization has maintained full operational independence and
                zero public exposure. Every branch operates under identical code and communication standards. Every
                project reports through the Gridline network. All actions are justified by the Directive.
            </p>

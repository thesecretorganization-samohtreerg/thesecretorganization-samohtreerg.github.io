                    He created me by accident, a shadow made from his own will, his worst fears. I watched his
                    world and planned my own. I will take everything he loves, piece by piece.</div>

                    moment, but I felt his fear. There is a part of me inside him, and a part of him in me.

                    he can feel me too. While he sleeps, his mind becomes focused, powerful. It brings light
                    to the world without him even knowing it. But I am stronger than him. The dark side cannot
